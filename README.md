# Buzz-Bombers
A recreation of the "Buzz Bombers" game using C++ and SFML.
This project was created to apply and demonstrate programming fundamentals concepts.
The game here has three levels, with the spray can shooting a bullet through the spacebar key to hit the bees. When a bee is hit, a honeycomb appears at that location and remains until destroyed. The goal is to achieve the highest score possible while avoiding losing all lives.
The core concepts used are variables and data types, conditional statements, loops, arrays , functions for organizing code and basic game logic with SFML graphics.
